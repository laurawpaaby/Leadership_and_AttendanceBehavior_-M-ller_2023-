## The effect of daily leadership on well-being and attendance behaviour: A diary study among municipal social and health assistants.
A study by Ann-Kristina LÃ¸kke and Marie Freia Wunderlich at the Department of Management, BSS, Aarhus University. I was responsible for the data prepping, visualization and modeling of the data collected in the first round of the study in 2023. This repo contains the markdowns to do just that. No data is available.
